# Project Can Of Books

Authors: Jon Rumsey and Raul Zarate
Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

Create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.  

The front end is deployed to [Netlify](https://spontaneous-frangipane-cf3f7d.netlify.app/)  

## Getting Started

1. Install node (version 12+ preferred). Use `node --version` to confirm.  
1. Install npm and update to version 8+. Use `npm --version` to confirm.  
1. Clone this repository and the backend repository from [Raul's GitHub (Repo Name TBD)](https://github.com/zaratr). Keep them separate on your local git.  
1. Run `npm install` in the root to install and update node_modules.  
1. Run `npm start` to launch a new browser window, running this app.

### Logitstics

Working Hours: Noon to 1800 Daily.  
Communications Platforms: Slack.  
Breaks: Every 2 hours take 10 minutes to fuel up, breathe, and hydrate.  
Fall-behind Plan: After utilizing TA assistance for a reasonable amount of time, we will communicate with our instructor.  

### Cooperation

#### Strengths

Raul is good at seeking assistance rapidly, will take a task and run with it with little ramp-up time. Raul's javascript skills are well-honed and Raul is not fearful of taking on other peoples code or work through coding issues. Raul will use these skills along the way to drive development and testing of the project.

Jon is good with managing projects from start to finish, and documenting project work along the way. Jon will stay on top of the work in the queue, and help to ensure coding duties are shared between us through communicating "lets swap roles" as we go, to divvy-up the work.  

#### Professional Development

Raul plans to get a better grasp on how to set up, configure, deploy, and manage Heroku back-end service.
Jon plans to develop skills using javascript, mongo and mongoose, errorhanding, and promises (as applies) through added study and paired programming events.

Jon and Raul have agreed to pair-program, and swap roles regularly through the coding processes of this project to ensure we each have a chance to navigate and drive.

#### Conflict Resolution

Raul and Jon have agreed to actively ask each other how we can help, rather than "close up" or acting in a way that avoids being a team player.  
On the off chance this happens, we agree that taking the matter to our instructor and ask for arbitration.
Jon and Raul agree to work peacefully, and in the best interests of each other, and of the project, to resolve all matters through the life of this project.

Raul and Jon understand we each have strengths and limitations, and agree to work this project as a unified team, with the common goals of building software development skills, teamwork and collaboration, and completing the project requirements each day to the best of our collective abilities.
